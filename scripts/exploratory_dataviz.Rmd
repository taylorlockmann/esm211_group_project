```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup


```{r}
# Read in libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
# Read in the data to use
squid_fishing_data <- read.csv(here("data", "fishing_effort_per_block.csv"))
```


## Exploratory Data Viz

### Lbs vs # Receipts

```{r}
ggplot(data = squid_fishing_data, aes(x = catch_receipts, y = catch_lbs))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Pounds of Squid Caught vs Number of Receipts Reported",
       subtitle = "Including zero receipts or lbs caught")
```


### Fishing effort over time

```{r}
ggplot(data = squid_fishing_data)+
  geom_point(aes(x = landing_month, y = catch_per_receipts, color = landing_year))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Pounds of Squid Caught Per Landing Receipt")
```

# 2/24 notes
# Next steps: consolidate catch per unit effort into one value per year. Then look at trends across time, especially identifying El Nino years.
